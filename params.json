{"name":"Service-connector","tagline":"Connecting jQuery & Spring framework via SOA architecture","body":"### Welcome to Service-connector project in Coronado Land\r\nThe Service-Connector is a repository in Github. This repository provides an architecture to create faster applications using the SOA paradigm. The flexibility of SOA provides the powerful of services development for a complex system. Developing system \"by services\" is like constructing huge buildings \"by bricks\".\r\n\r\nService connector links the browser with Java services. It's based on Spring Framework and jQuery framework. The connector is multi layer and multi language architecture because it needs part on Java (business layer) and it needs part on Javascript to browser layer. Both layers connect via JSON protocol using AJAX.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Vision and Mission\r\nI believe that my experience can be shared to help others. This project is my experience wrapped of nice software. \r\nUsing this software you can deploy faster and secure projects and invest your time in other important things.\r\n\r\n### Core features in browser layer\r\n- Based in jQuery\r\n- Full support AJAX connection in declarative way.\r\n- Restful support\r\n- Integration with decorative effects on asynchronous invocations\r\n- Control of server errors\r\n- Extensive using of deferred objects.\r\n\r\n### Core features in business layer\r\n- Full based on Spring Framework\r\n- Using JSON or XML with service modification\r\n- Authentication in all methods invoked\r\n- Localization in all methods served.\r\n\r\n### Extended features\r\n- Error registration in business layer included all information to be traced or managed in browser area\r\n- Integrated with other connectors like persistence connector\r\n\r\n### License.\r\nThe code is free for any project, but read [License agreement](https://raw.github.com/coronadoland/service-connector/master/LICENSE.txt)\r\n\r\n### How to use it\r\nJust download from [coronadoland/service-connector](https://github.com/coronadoland/service-connector) and use in your code.\r\n\r\n### The last thing to know\r\nPlease enjoy.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
